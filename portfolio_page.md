_Project: Emoji Dictionary_

_Description: This project displays emojis in a table view. The user selects an emoji and the screen segues to the definition page for that emoji with an enlarged image and a short text description._

_Challenges: The main challenges of this project were passing around the emoji variables from the list where they originate (the home table view) to the definition page. This challenge was solved by using the "sender" object throughout the functions. Additionally, matching descriptions to each emoji was a challenge but solved using an "emoji" class._

# MacOS Projects

## ToDo List
<table><tr>
<td> <img src="todo1.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="todo2.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px;"/> </td>
<td> <img src="todo3.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 250px;"/> </td>
</tr></table>
_Project: ToDo List_

_Description: This project presents a window with a table view of tasks, including names and an importance indicator, with ability to add and delete tasks. The delete button only shows up when a task is clicked._

_Challenges: The main challenges of this project were implementing the importance indicator. Since the indicator relies on the "important" box to be checked, logic that interprets the status of that box was included. The solution was to use an "if-else" statement to decide whether or not a task was indicated as important._
